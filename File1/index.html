<div class="a"> Frogs that live in trees are known as tree frogs, although they may be referred to by different names in some regions. An interesting fact about tree frogs is that they can be found on every continent except Antarctica. While this might not be considered a fun fact, it is noteworthy that tree frogs inhabit all continents except for Antarctica. Some tree frogs have bright red eyes and vibrant lime green bodies, while others have black eyes and green bodies.</div>
